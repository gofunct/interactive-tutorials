In this scenario, you will learn how to deploy PyTorch workloads using Kubeflow. 

The example uses a Distributed MNIST Model created using PyTorch which will be trained using Kubeflow and Kubernetes.

The Kubeflow project is dedicated to making Machine Learning on Kubernetes easy, portable and scalable. The goal is not to recreate other services, but to provide a straightforward way for spinning up best of breed OSS solutions.

Details of the project can be found at https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow
