The second key component of Kubeflow is the ability to run Jupyter Notebooks via JupyterHub. [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) is the classic data science tool to run inline scripts and code snippets while documenting the process in the browser.

## Open Jupyter Hub

Via Katacoda, you can access the browser interface at the following link https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com or using the terminal *Jupyterhub* tab. To access the JupyterHub use the username **`admin`{{copy}}** and a blank password in the login form.

To deploy a notebook, a new server has to be started. Kubeflow is using internally the **`gcr.io/kubeflow-images-public/tensorflow-1.8.0-notebook-cpu:v0.2.1`{{copy}}** Docker Image as default. After accessing the JupyterHub, you can click **Start My server** button.


The server launcher allows you to configure additional options, such as resource requirements. In this case, accept the defaults and click **Spawn** to start the server. Now you can see the contents of the Docker image that you can navigate, extend and work with Jupyter Notebooks.

Under the covers, this will Spawn a new Kubernetes Pod for managing the server. View this using `kubectl get pods -n ${NAMESPACE} jupyter-admin`{{execute}}

### Working with Jupyter Notebook

JupyterHub can now be accessed via the pod. You can now work with the environment seamlessly. For example to create a new notebook, select the New dropdown, and select the Python 3 kernel as shown below.

It's now possible to create code snippets. To start working with TensorFlow, paste the code below to the first cell and run it.

<pre class="file" data-target="clipboard">
from __future__ import print_function

import tensorflow as tf

hello = tf.constant('Hello TensorFlow!')
s = tf.Session()
print(s.run(hello))
</pre>
