In this scenario, you will learn how to deploy different Machine Learning workloads using Kubeflow and Kubernetes. The interactive environment is a two-node Kubernetes cluster allowing you to experience Kubeflow and deploy real workloads to understand how it can solve your problems.

The Kubeflow project is dedicated to making Machine Learning on Kubernetes easy, portable and scalable. The goal is not to recreate other services, but to provide a straightforward way for spinning up best of breed OSS solutions.
