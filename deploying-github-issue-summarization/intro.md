This example demonstrates how you can use `kubeflow` end-to-end to train and
serve a Sequence-to-Sequence model on an existing kubernetes cluster. This
tutorial is based upon the article ["How To Create Data Products That
Are Magical Using Sequence-to-Sequence
Models"](https://medium.com/@hamelhusain/how-to-create-data-products-that-are-magical-using-sequence-to-sequence-models-703f86a231f8).
